    <p>Watch you all come here when the recession hits</p>

<p> It tells you to rip your disks to host them on a Jellyfin Server </p>
<img src="Diagram.jpg" alt="This image shows a disk going into a disk reader which gets riped to the computer ands played on a phone, showing the method used in the video" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
<p>The problem with streaming service is they are too expensive with too little content that people care about, and their are too many</p>  
<p>Netflix with ads, Netflix with less content, and so many ads that you will lose it, in HD and only one person can watch at a time. Will will defently not raise our prices in the future but we gaming company now</p>  
<p>Also the PS3 can play lots, but the ps4 pro or xbox one S may be needed for 4k </p>
